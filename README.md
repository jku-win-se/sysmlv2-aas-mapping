##Abstract: 
This paper proposes a model-driven engineering approach that leverages higher-order transformations and the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as a pivotal model to tackle the interoperability challenges associated with digital twin systems. The paper illustrates the approach through a vehicle use case represented using the Systems Modeling Language version 2 (SysML v2) and consolidating this description into an AAS model. The paper also provides an Ecore-based implementation of the AAS information metamodel and the mapping rules between SysML v2 and AAS.
